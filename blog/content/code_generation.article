* Summary

For GopherAcademy's advent calendar, Ernesto Jim√©nez talks about go generate:

- Why can we build tools with Go that will help reduce boilerplate using code generation.
- What are the building blocks for code generation in Go.
- Where can we find examples of code generation tools to learn more.

Go was designed to make language comprehension tools easier to make,
and provides the needed machinery to generate code (go templates)
