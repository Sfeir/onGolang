* Summary

Dave Cheney shares his thoughts on logging.
The built-ing logging facility can be considered a bit poor compared to other languages, as for instance, it doesn't provide different logging levels. 
Dave mentions a few alternative logging, clearly inspired by other languages or platforms.
But actually, Dave posits that those more advanced logging libraries are actually doing too much, and don't necessarily lead developers towards good logging practices.
Dave believes that developers should only log what they care about when developing or debugging software, and logging things users care abour when using your software.
