* Summary

Alec Winograd : "We wanted to start moving away from infrastructure utilities written
in Python and Bash. While we wanted to move away from both due to lack of strong types,
Bash in particular has caused numerous headaches due to its odd edge-cases. Overall,
we're glad we picked Go. It's an extremely easy language to pick up in large part due
to its excellent documentation and just as easy to deploy with a single compiled binary."
