* Summary

Nick Gauthier : "Go is like coming back to formal programming after the crazy world of Ruby for a little while. It reminds me of C with all the sharp corners sanded off; Go is such a simple language. Some of my favorite things in the programming world are tests, web applications, and databases. Half of all my talks are about tests, in fact. So letâ€™s talk about testing in Go."
