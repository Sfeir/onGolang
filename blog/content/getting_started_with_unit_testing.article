* Summary

Let's start the new year with a good resolution: unit testing our Go code!

In this article, an introduction to the unit testing facilities of Go is presented,
explaining some of the conventions used, like file locations, naming standards, creating a test suite, etc.

The author also demonstrates the [[https://github.com/stretchr/testify][Testify]] library,
which provides more advanced assertion capabilities.

Along with details on how to define different test profiles, for a quicker round of tests, skipping some of them,
we also get a chance to look at the built-in test coverage support provided by the go test command.
