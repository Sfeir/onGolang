* Summary

It’s been 418 days since my first Github commit of Go code. In that time I’ve written a Syslog-to-Kafka producer, a Raft-based distributed SQLite database, a near real-time log search system, and become a core developer of InfluxDB.

So if there is one word to summarize Go, it’s productive.
