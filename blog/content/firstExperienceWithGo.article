* Summary

Wojciech Adam Koszek : "The other day I stumbled upon a Google Drive command line client. Itâ€™s a software project written in the Go language. It lets you access Google Drive from the command line. I felt it was a great project, and I wanted to give it a shot, so I started reading."

Solution to get and build a Go project :
	 mkdir "$HOME/gopath"
	 export GOPATH="$HOME/gopath"
	 export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"
	 go get github.com/prasmussen/gdrive
