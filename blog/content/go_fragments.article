* Summary

Learning a language like Go isn't taking a long time, but mastering the associated APIs can be more challenging as they cover lots of different topics you don't necessarily need at all times.
Go Fragments features a collection of Go annotated example programs, that cover fundamentals, currency, or net and web areas.
