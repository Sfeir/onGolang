* Summary

On the CloudFlare blog, Filippo Valsorda shows a hack on
how to get end-to-end test coverage from the main entry point of your application,
rather than with just coverage for unit tests.
And he advises to use the GoCoMerge project to finally merge the usual unit tests coverage
as well as the report from the main application.
